# ðŸŽµ How TuneCent Works

At its core, TuneCent connects **Artists**, **Fans**, and **Investors** through a **tokenized royalty system**.

**Flow Overview**

1. **Artist uploads song** â†’ registers as a digital asset on-chain.
2. **Royalties tokenized** â†’ fans can buy or stake tokens tied to that track.
3. **Revenue sharing** â†’ as streams grow, token holders share proportional rewards.
4. **Fan-Artist loop** â†’ engagement and popularity directly drive token value.

**Example Case**

> **Artist A** launches a single on TuneCent.\
> 1,000,000 tokens are minted for that track.\
> Each token represents 0.0001% royalty.\
> Fans buy, trade, or hold tokens.\
> When the track earns $10,000 from royalties â†’ holders get their share automatically.
